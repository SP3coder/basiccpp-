# basiccpp-

This project is basically small programs which i am learning for my personal use.
There are 3 aspects to these codes:
1. WOrking with cmake. A proper build structure is made and code is compiled and run using cmake.
2. Working on good c++ concepts and putting codes to understand them.
3. Working with git and understand SCM.

Please use my code for better understanding of cmake, c++ and git.
